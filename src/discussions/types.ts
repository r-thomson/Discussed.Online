The system here is a bit complex and could definitely use some simplification,
but here is the basic idea:

Ultimately, we want to start with a URL and end up with a site-specific search
query. Different sites will to implement different query-building logic, on a
per-search-API basis. This is currently implemented via the visitor pattern.

It's a little OOP-y for my JavaScript tastes, but it gets the job done.
